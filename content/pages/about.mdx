## About me

With 12+ years of professional experience in the front-end space, I am deeply passionate about creating experiences that delight the user, with a keen emphasis on accessibility, usability, and performance. I work mainly with **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Typescript**, **React**, and **Node.js**.

If I had to classify myself, I would say my interest/area of focus has shifted more towards the ["back-of-the-front-end"](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/) in the great front-end developer divide.

Meaning, in addition to building the UI, I also love tinkering with JavaScript-based tools and infrastructure (CLI tools, monorepos, bundlers, etc), devops stuff (deployment tooling, CI/CD integration, etc), and all the functionality that encompasses app business logic (CRUD, routing, cache, auth, etc).

Truthfully, I love to get my hands dirty with a little bit of everything, and love learning new things.

In my downtime, you can probably find me exploring Portland, thrifting, playing video games, or tinkering/contributing to open source!
