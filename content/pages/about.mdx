## About me

I am a Software Engineer specializing in front-end JavaScript development, with 12+ years of professional experience in the front-end space. My goal is to craft experiences that delight the user, with a keen emphasis on accessibility, usability, and performance.

In my downtime, you can probably find me **exploring Portland**, **thrifting**, playing **video games**, or tinkering/contributing to **open source**.

Currently, in my day-to-day, I work mainly with **JavaScript**, **Typescript**, **React**, and **Node.js**.

### Interest/area of focus

While my roots lie in web development (HTML/CSS), I would say my interest has shifted more towards the ["back-of-the-front-end"](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/) (in the great front-end developer divide).

In addition to building the UI and interactions, I also love tinkering with JavaScript-based tools and infrastructure (CLI tools, monorepos, bundlers, etc), DevOps stuff (deployment tooling, CI/CD integration, etc), and all the functionality that encompasses app business logic (CRUD, routing, caching, auth, and so on).

Truthfully, I just love to get my hands dirty with a little bit of everything and love learning new things.
