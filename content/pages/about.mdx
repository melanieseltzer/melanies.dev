## About me

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in front-end JavaScript development.

My pronouns are **she/her**.

I love all things **TypeScript**, **React**, **Next.js**, but love getting my hands dirty with a bit of everything across the stack.

Currently most interested in expanding my knowledge on more backend-related tasks (databases, caching, auth, etc), hacking on JavaScript-based infrastructure and tooling (bundlers, CLI tools, etc), and maximizing developer productivity.

I live in **Portland, Oregon**, and in my free time, you can probably find me exploring the city, thrifting, playing video games, or tinkering/contributing to open source.
