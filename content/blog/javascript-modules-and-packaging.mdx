summary: Simple cheat sheet compiling everything I've learned about about JavaScript modules and packaging in one place.
---

As I've started dipping my toes into the world of publishing packages on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), I've often been overwhelmed with all the different terminology and options. This is my attempt at gathering as much information in one place for a quick reference.

## Definitions

### `"ECMAScript Modules"` aka `"ES modules"` aka `"ESM"`

- The official standard format.
- Works in many modern browsers.
- Defined using import and export statements.
- Tree-shakeable.

### `"CommonJS"` aka `"CJS"`

- Original way to package JavaScript code for Node.js.
- Needs to be transpiled/bundled to work in browser.
- In Node.js, each file is treated as a separate module.

### `"Universal Module Definition"` aka `"UMD"`

- Capable of working everywhere (client or server).
- Usually used as a fallback module when using bundler like Rollup/Webpack.

### `"dual packaging"`

- Include both CommonJS and ES module JavaScript sources.
- Be wary of the [dual package hazard](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#dual-package-hazard).

## File Extensions

### `.mjs`

- JavaScript files that are ESM.

### `.mts`

- TypeScript files that are ESM.

### `.cjs`

- JavaScript files that are CommonJS.
- `.cjs` file extension overrides `"type": "module"` in package.json.

## Packaging (`package.json` fields)

### `main`

- Specify the CommonJS entry point.
- Read more: https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#main

### `module`

- Specify the ES module (ESM) entry point.
- Not officially defined by Node.js (community went with `exports` instead).
- It originally came from a [proposal](https://github.com/dherman/defense-of-dot-js/blob/master/proposal.md) for how to integrate ECMAScript modules into Node.
- Used by JavaScript bundlers (esbuild, Webpack, Rollup) for ESM detection.

### `type`

- `"type": "commonjs"` tells Node.js to parse all `.js` files under the package.json as CommonJS.
- `"type": "module"` tells Node.js to parse all `.js` files under the package.json as ESM.
- If `type` is not specified, defaults to parsing `.js` files as CommonJS.
- Node.js looks for the _closest_ package.json to decide whether to parse `.js` as ESM or CommonJS.
  - Therefore, if a package in `node_modules` _does not_ have `"type": "module"` in its package.json _OR_ a dual export, its `.js` files will be parsed as CommonJS.

### `exports`

- Supported in Node.js 12+ as alternative to `"main"`.
- Define **subpath exports** and **conditional exports** while encapsulating internal unexported modules.
- Read more: https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports

#### Subpath exports

- Custom subpaths can be defined along with the main entry point.
- Read more: https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-exports

```json some-package/package.json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": "./foo.js",
    "./bar.js": "./src/bar.js"
  }
}
```

Only defined subpaths can then be imported by a consumer, other imports will error:

```js
import bar from 'some-package/bar'; // okay!
import private from 'some-package/something-private.js'; // nope!
```

In the absence of multiple subpaths, `"."` has no purpose!

```json package.json
"exports": {
  ".": {
    "require": "./dist/index.cjs",
    "default": "./dist/index.modern.js"
  }
}
```

...is equivalent to:

```json package.json
  "exports": {
    "require": "./dist/index.cjs",
    "default": "./dist/index.modern.js"
  }
```

#### Conditional exports

- Different package entry points per environment. A single module exports both ESM (allowing it to be imported) and CommonJS (allowing it to be required) via the `exports` field.
- Read more: https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports

```json package.json
{
  "exports": {
    "import": "./foo.js", // Entry-point for `import "foo"` in ESM
    "require": "./foo.cjs" // Entry-point for `require("foo")` in CJS
  }
}
```

### `exports.types`

- TypeScript typings for NodeNext modules (see: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/esm-node.html) aka the new support.
- Must come first in the list:

```json package.json
{
  "exports": {
    "types": "./foo.d.ts", // TypeScript typings for NodeNext modules
    "import": "./foo.js", // Entry-point for `import "foo"` in ESM
    "require": "./foo.cjs" // Entry-point for `require("foo")` in CJS
  }
}
```

### `types`

- TypeScript's original Node support aka fallback for older versions of TypeScript.
- TypeScript looks for the `main` field then looks for declaration files that corresponded to that entry (e.g. if `"main"` points to `./foo.js`, TypeScript would look for a file called `./foo.d.ts`).
