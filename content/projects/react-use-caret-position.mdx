## Motivation

If there is some side effect/async code in an input's `onChange` event handler (e.g. dispatching a Redux action without doing anything else, format text in some way like uppercase, etc), the caret will annoyingly be booted to the end of the input after each keystroke.

`react-use-caret-position` fixes this undesirable behavior by keeping track of the caret position and setting it on render.
